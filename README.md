### This Python 3 program asks for a word. Then checks in a local dictionary set and returns the definition of exact match, or close match upon acceptance.

#### This program can be used for quick command line dictionary lookup or suggest a close match for display.

Four outcomes can be expected:

1. Word found and definition displayed.
2. There is a close match and prompts user to accept, if yes, then continues to display definition with message of match ratio percentage.
3. If no or input is not recognized, then program terminates.
4. Word or close match not found, program also terminates.
