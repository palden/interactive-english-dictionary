### This Python3 program asks for a word. Then checks for it in a local dictionary set. 

Four outcomes can be expected:

1. Word found and definition displayed.
2. There is a close match and prompts user to accept, If yes, then continues to display with message of match ratio percentage.
3. If no, then program terminates.
4. Word or close match not found, program also terminates.
