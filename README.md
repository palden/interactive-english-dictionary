### This Python 3 program asks for a word. Then checks in a local dictionary set and returns the definition of exact match, or close match upon acceptance.

Four outcomes can be expected:

1. Word found and definition displayed.
2. There is a close match and prompts user to accept, if yes, then continues to display with message of match ratio percentage.
3. If no, then program terminates.
4. Word or close match not found, program also terminates.
